# Tor starter (for OS X)

This script sets up network preferences to use a local [Tor](http://www.torproject.org/) server, starts Tor, and resets preferences after you stop it.

## Usage

    brew install tor # if you didn't install it already
    ./tor_starter.sh Wi-Fi # for example

The script will ask you for your password.
